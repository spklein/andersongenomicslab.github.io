Though they are the primary root organ responsible for the uptake of water and nutrients required for plant growth and development, roots are an often underexploited breeding target for abiotic stress tolerance. This is partially because roots are inherently difficult to study: occluded by soil and physically demanding to excavate. Roots are also highly responsive to their environment as wide ranges of phenotypic variation and plastic responses to changes in their environment. Previous work has linked various root traits that optimize the acquisition of resources, particularly when these resources are limited. Despite this, we still know remarkably little of how these desirable root traits are under genetic control or under control of other regulatory elements.

My major research interest is to understand how genetic and genomic variation contribute to root phenotypic diversity and abiotic stress responses, specifically to low nitrogen availability. A substantial portion of variation in the maize genome is due to transposable elements, which have been shown to modulate the expression of nearby genes and be responsive to external stimuli. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to integrate the genome, transcriptome, and phenome to help generate new crop varieties that will be beneficial for low input and industrial agricultural systems alike.
